title: Link State Routing
---

## Aim

To implement and simulate algorithm for link state routing protocol.

## Theory

Link-State Routing Protocols are one of the two main classes of routing protocols
used in packet switching networks for computer communications, the other being
distance-vector routing protocols. Examples of link-state routing protocols include
Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) and Intermediate System to Intermediate System
(IS-IS).

The link-state protocol is performed by every switching node in the network
(i.e., nodes that are prepared to forward packets; in the Internet, these are called
routers). The basic concept of link-state routing is that every node constructs a map
of the connectivity to the network, in the form of a graph, showing which nodes are
connected to which other nodes. Each node then independently calculates the next
best logical path from it to every possible destination in the network. Each collection
of best paths will then form each nodeâ€™s routing table.

## Algorithm

1. Start
2. Read the cost matrix
3. Read the source router
4. For v in routers
   1. If v is a neighbour of u, distance[v] = cost[u][v]
   2. Else, distance[v] = inf
   3. Iterate over the routes in the network and find a node w such that distance[w] is minimum
   4. Print distance[v] for all nodes v
